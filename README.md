# Compound-Interest-Calculator

This compound interest calculator prompts a user for some inputs and then calculates the compound interest value.

### Methodology

1. Define a function that can be used to calculate the final value of the compounded interest.

2. Define a function that would calculate the difference e.g. the effect that the compounding has had.

3. Create a run function that then prompts the user for all necessary inputs required to calculate the final amounts.

4. Inside of a said function, make a nice pretty print statement using a template literal string that gives the financial breakdown.
